# The Madman's Quotations

1. Apt is all new versions of libc, so you can’t use it on an old system. But the new system restricts your freedom in various ways, with all sorts of background services that act like malware.

2. When your Linux upgrades to macOS on an M1, do you still have root privileges? Fake root privileges—don't even think about disabling Apple's services.

3. Without internet, you can't install gcc, and your C code becomes plain text. Imagine paying a dollar per compilation, being forced to bind your phone number, or scan a WeChat QR code. I’m just speculating, but it could happen in the future.

4. Xubuntu and the latest Ubuntu versions have fallen. There’s even a Mahjong game—probably under Chinese control.

5. I checked it out, and it's a bit dangerous. All those versions of WinRunner are using a single disk. I suggest someone proposes to hu60 to create a one-click reset, so no one has to ask every time.

6. Running the English version of E Language works fine. It suggests Wu Tao has gone rogue and added a backdoor to the new version of E Language.

7. I carefully studied the terms of E Language and found a clause saying, "The company reserves the right to upgrade this software by providing you with replacement or modified versions of it at any time." Doesn’t that mean that Yifeiyang could pry open your hard drive anytime and force a restricted, non-free compiler on you? Forced updates without the user’s consent. E Language looks like a big trap, just like Windows.

8. I regret to inform you that Black Moon doesn’t have the ability to compile software without purchasing E Language. If you use Python, it's much easier; there are plenty of third-party executors.

9. Any work based on Windows is illegal labor because you cannot provide a legitimate Windows installation image.

10. Recently, when writing MRP mobile programs, I needed to use Windows, but there were no line breaks when opening documents on XP. I searched for hours for a text editor on XP, like XP’s version of VSCode, and couldn’t find one. It’s like starting a business—you lose millions on land, equipment, and hiring before you even make any money. If you start developing offline, the text editor is obviously the most basic tool you'd create first, and it would be incredibly polished because you've been honing it for over a decade.

11. Where can you find a desktop system with 200MB of memory? 32-bit software is exceptionally stable.

12. The Skye mobile SDK isn’t open-source, leaving only Windows binary C libraries, making it heavily reliant on Windows.

13. What’s the relationship between Linux, Windows, and macOS? Linux is a tool, tricking users into developing open-source software. Then, the good projects and ideas get turned into closed-source products by Windows and macOS and sold to customers. Meanwhile, Linux’s free software forces protocol upgrades, making older software and frameworks unusable, leaving you with only closed-source products. Even if you have the source code, without a usable compiler and hardware, it’s all for nothing. The garbage new version of gcc can’t even compile its old version; that’s how poor compatibility is.

14. I guarantee that after upgrading, my old computer runs slower and less efficiently.

15. Without internet, can there still be security issues?

16. If green software can't implement the new features you want, it means your computer is being controlled by rogue background services.

17. Your current freedom is all based on your ability to connect to the internet. GCC isn’t built-in; without the internet, you don’t have it. What’s the point of connecting to the internet? It’s not like everyone has an IP address—there’s only one purpose: 1984.

18. For example, if you don't pay your phone bill, you can’t even buy a server. Your ID card can’t even prove you’re a person.

19. Gitee.com doesn’t let you create projects if you don’t pay your phone bill because it requires phone binding. Your ID card can’t even prove you’re a person.

20. GitHub is also problematic, with forced two-factor authentication. It's just one step away from requiring you to bind a U.S. green card.

21. Are domestic service mobile verification codes so cheap? Why do they keep sending verification codes? Is it because the mobile network companies have colluded with the law, giving kickbacks to network service providers to force users to pay their phone bills? Hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue each month, monopolizing everything!

22. Without the backbone network, all the internet services you rely on will collapse. It’s someone else’s backbone network now, with no freedom of speech—you can only watch ads and consume.

23. Using the foreign internet means paying for VPNs and services. At home, you still have to pay for phone, electricity, and water bills. Endless consumption.

24. It's like a frog being boiled in warm water. In a few years, you'll understand.

25. How does freedom die? In the first year, there are no rules, and the feature is full of freedom. In the second year, the feature is too free, leading to security issues—let's disable it by default, with an option to enable it manually. In the third year, for the user's safety, the feature needs to be filed and a waiver signed before it can be enabled. In the fourth year, the feature is too free to be available to everyone—let's charge for it. In the fifth year, it's too much of a loss to let others use such a free feature—let’s keep it for ourselves and not let others use it.

26. It’s open-source—why not create a public account where anyone can post code, only deleting duplicate junk projects? Why doesn’t GitHub do that?

27. Impossible—GitHub won’t send me verification emails. They force me to use my phone to log in, like a verification app.

28. You still don’t get it. Domestically, they want you to pay for phone bills, and abroad, they want you to pay for VPNs.

29. Don’t pay either. Create your own backbone network. They’ll call you a gangster.

30. When you reach 30, you’ll realize that all the things you’re messing around with now are just traps set by others. Young people don't understand.

31. To put it simply, in the era of green software, using software required only two steps: download and run. But look at how much hu60 has written just to get software to run properly.

32. Here’s a question for you: how do you achieve hardware security? How do you ensure that the computer you buy today can still install Windows 10 and play your current games 20 years from now?

33. Reminds me of how some companies use Android ARM as the operating system for computers. Wrong answer.

34. They don’t allow flashing because of policy restrictions—they’re afraid you’ll bypass the browser’s whitelist settings.

35. Last time, I asked a seller on Taobao about an industrial control machine. He said hardware limitations prevented installing XP, but i32 Windows 7 could be installed. I found it unbelievable.

36. In 20 years, you’ll realize what a joke Windows 10 is. No high-end brain-computer interface drivers—it deserves to be uninstalled.

37. I wrote a BAT script and ran it with Wine Helper, but no window popped up. Where's the bug?

38. Go download an XP Python green version, not something from a group. See if you can find it. You might search for a whole day without success.

39. I’ve told you, without internet, your GCC dependency chain collapses.

40. Desktop Linux doesn’t even come with GCC by default anymore. It means that without the internet, all you can do is cry over the source code.

41. But you still need old APT data. For example, if I asked you to find Ubuntu 8’s mirror data now, it’s already lost.

42. Look at the garbled text behind E Language—it's baffling. There used to be a blank space with no icons. Why is it grayed out?

43. If you can’t look up how to pause a service file without the internet, you’ll have to reinstall the system. Green files are still the best.

44. When did Git switch to HTTP2? Are they planning reproductive isolation from HTTP1.1?

45. Even worse, you’re stuck using a decades-old system with the latest backdoor software.

46. That means you can’t use old tools like Curl or Wget anymore.

47. Can you check each of the thousands of npm dependencies one by one?

48. Software downloads have all collapsed—how do you update? If your server doesn’t have old programs, you can’t even download files on the local network.

49. People used to be dumber, and technology was immature. Just like you intercepting HTTP1.1, you have control over old software but not over SSL companies. If the SSL companies decide to block you across the network, you’re finished.

50. An ARM compiler requires 1.8GB—bigger than a High Energy Hero APK.

51. They don’t even allow local area networks to connect. What security issues are there in a LAN? I’m the only one using it. They’re just one step away from locking the hard drive, allowing only whitelisted files. This is true no-freedom.jpg.

52. Some browsers seem to be whitelisting already, making it impossible to access things even with a VPN. Blocking 127.0.0.1 is just around the corner.

53. I have no fear. If you need someone to handle anti-authoritarian or whistleblowing activities, I can be your spokesperson

.

54. It's frustrating—I’ve been unemployed for years.

55. I want to find an ISO file that can be installed in a virtual machine—Linux 1.0 or 0.01.

56. How did they use kernels in the last century? Isn’t a kernel just an in-memory operating system?

57. Android phone hardware drivers are encrypted. Otherwise, adapting to third-party systems would be easy.

58. It’s clear you’ve never adapted an Android system—talking nonsense. Screen, keyboard, speaker, lights, microphone, network card—they don’t give you access to any of them.

59. The green button is unclickable—so which one should I download to install?

60. I suddenly realized this is an extinct system—only a few MBs, and it comes with GCC.

61.
   - Me: C-based SDL-based browser?
   - AI: No.
   - Me: So, before C++ came out, you didn’t use browsers?

62. ARM chips are really garbage. You have to pay for compilers. The latest version might even require login credentials to upload code. Cracking software is, of course, illegal. I’ve never heard of paying for a compiler or code uploader. STM chips require several GBs of IDE installation, plus a JDK that requires an account to download. It doesn’t feel very free. [Link to Stack Overflow discussion about ARM compiler instrumentation option]

63. Android, Skye phones, and other ARM chip-based systems might all have security issues. One order from the ARM factory, and everything shuts down. Or with one slip of the ARM factory’s hand, only code compiled by their official compiler can be used by the chip.

64. Python, PHP, GCC, and Dart are garbage because their new versions are not backward compatible with old syntax. But JavaScript in browsers is different—even if you use the oldest JavaScript syntax, the latest browsers will execute it correctly. Not only do they support old syntax, but the core libraries are also compatible. On the other hand, Python can't even handle old syntax, which is really trash. And GCC’s new version can't even compile its old version source code—totally incompatible with old syntax. Trash.

65. The original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) hardware was an 8-bit system with a processor running at 1.7897725 MHz, with 2KB of main memory (RAM) and 2KB of video memory (VRAM). This level of system could run smooth 320x240 pixel games. Modern microcontrollers are far more advanced, but many of us using C or MicroPython can't reproduce the same smooth games or graphical interfaces, with memory easily getting exhausted. This shows that contemporary programmers' abilities have indeed declined—the software they produce is getting larger in size and lower in performance.

66. That's correct. Recently, I wrote a GUI library in Python, and on a $10,000 computer, it takes a second to render a 1080p image—too slow. Even if C is 60 times faster, it doesn't help, as memory still gets exhausted.

67. That’s not even slow. Some stupid 3D rendering engines take all night to render an image with GPU. The developer must be stupid, taking advantage of users' ignorance.

68. Postmarket's adaptation tutorials are just scams, tricking people into buying junk phones. Clearly, Postmarket isn’t a good thing either. [Link to PostmarketOS wiki on Samsung Galaxy A3 2015]

69. Geniuses use 3,000 commits and still can’t write a proper universal PNG protocol. As an idiot, I wrote a universal picture protocol in 500 lines of Python code. Geniuses are amazing at complicating simple things.

70. Compared to the first-generation Google Pixel, other phones are subpar for flashing. As an idiot, my DIY phone’s protocol is simpler than theirs.

71. I don’t need to send you code—I’ll explain the structure. Battery, screen, motherboard, SD/TF card module. Each module is detachable and replaceable. And I have root access at the Python level, though I can’t escape the CPU’s GCC. Fortunately, the CPU is replaceable too. The microcontroller is just a 10 yuan RMB Pico. Replacing it is no big deal. So when I compare, I smash my Samsung. After all, my image protocol is just a 320x240 pixel matrix/2D array—so simple that anyone can do it.

72. But if you study the JPG protocol, after writing thousands or tens of thousands of lines of code, you'll realize it has no compatibility at all and can only decode the image you tested. That’s why I say geniuses complicate simple things.

73. If you try to stream images or videos using Android, TWRP, or the like, your brain will explode—you won’t succeed. They deliberately make it complicated, even having different driver passwords for each device. As they say, "dongle."

74. Arguing with you is pointless—I’m giving you knowledge. After all, I'm also under control, able to build one machine but can’t build a second one because I lack the same parts.

75. I’m no different from big factories like Foxconn, just an assembler who can’t reproduce the same model ten years later because the parts are discontinued. I'm not the head of all parts.

76. I found a major problem with HTTPS: almost all Android 7.0 and earlier versions can’t connect to HTTPS websites anymore, reporting a "certification_verify_failed" error. The main reason is that the certificate provider's certificates have expired. If you've always used an IP address with your encryption scheme, you won’t be affected—the service can run stably for 20 years. But if you use someone else's solution, the service won’t last five years—either it won’t compile, or it won’t be accessible. If you download an old Android system and it still connects to HTTPS normally, it’s not old—it’s fake.

77. I’ll send you a VPN—see if it works. Besides the Android 7 I recently downloaded, all other old versions are down.

78. By the way, why doesn’t V2Ray work on Android 4.4 anymore? It’s not a software issue; it’s because HTTPS can’t be accessed on old devices, and your server address is HTTPS. Why not use IP? Because IP is blocked—only Cloudflare isn’t. The problem is that this forces you to use new devices and upgrades, disallowing downgrades. By the way, Tencent's server is ridiculous—I used it as a springboard to run V2Ray, and it accused me of bypassing censorship and banned me. It seems their server has a backdoor constantly scanning ports.

79. Did you try my VPN link? It’s also HTTPS—see if it gives an error when starting.

80. You know about VirtualXposed, right? It only works on Android 9 and below, except for Xiaomi, as Xiaomi has modified the system. If you’re scared, you can use VirtualXposed’s virtual machine to check it out.

81. When you mention this, I think it might be using some Java HTTP library. And that library is arrogantly using the latest SSL certifications, leading to old versions being unable to connect. From the error message, it looks like a C-level issue—probably with a broad impact.

82. It’s not just Android 7. I have several phones, all on Android 9, running the LeTV system. Some phones also give errors. The difference might be that one system was compiled in 2018, the other in 2020. SSL might be hardcoded into the OS. Feels like we’re being led by the nose.

83. Android source code is deeply tied to SSL.

84. Manually updating SSL is exhausting.

85. They can’t possibly help you make your server compatible with old devices because their dependencies don’t allow it (HTTPS service framework).

86. Those small websites that entrust their fate to Cloudflare have reduced their user base to devices from the past five years. Some even have CAPTCHAs enabled by default—I can’t prove I’m human while hiding behind a domestic NAT unless I bypass the firewall.

87. I’ve been doing this for many years, recently manually disabling various throttling and verification features. Without a VPN, sometimes you get stuck on the white screen verification page.

88. Look at this SSL type—I counted almost nine…all are unstable factors.

89. Cloudflare's non-strict mode also has throttling—you didn’t look closely at the options.

90. I’ll tell you how to resist. In 2005, Tencent encrypted at the TCP layer, never using SSL. They completely disregarded the SSL management layer.

91. Certificate providers—if you’re engaged in grey or anti-authoritarian activities, they can revoke your certificate at any time. But Tencent’s method isn’t affected by SSL.

92. You should ask CoolQ—I don’t understand.

93. I’m done chatting—let’s talk again when there are new issues.

94. There was a sick chicken—I knew it was about to die, just like its dozen or so siblings with stomachs full of poisonous potato leaf garbage that they couldn’t expel. I wanted to remove the contents from its stomach with tweezers, so I cut open its crop. But I realized that a chick isn’t like a large chicken—my index finger couldn’t reach its stomach, and my tweezers were too big. So I had no choice but to euthanize it—I used scissors to cut off its head. Then I cut open its chest. A miracle happened—its heart was still beating. I guessed that the heart or body could survive without the brain. So I started blowing on the heart with my mouth, keeping it warm and moist, and it kept beating for another 10 minutes. Then I cut out its stomach and found it was indeed full of potato leaves that couldn’t be expelled.

95. Chapter 112: A Brief Discussion on the Highest Permission (What is the highest permission, root?) What is root? What is the highest permission? If you are the manufacturer of the device, you have the highest permission. If you are the manufacturer of the chip, you have the highest permission. If you are the founder and actual maintainer of a country, you have the highest permission. If you are the creator of the world, you are God—you have the highest permission.

96. Core developers only hold a portion of the permissions.

97. Product producers can't touch the device? Then who wrote the bootlock? Who implemented the automatic BIOS updates below the kernel and the flash that requires a password? If they don’t tell you the flash protocol, let’s see how long it takes you to crack it with an oscilloscope on 60 lines. I don’t want to curse.

98. Android CPUs come with built-in memory storage chips, and many also have integrated persistent storage. I’ve observed this when taking apart phones.

99. The mention of open-source makes me angry. None of those things reach the chip level—they’re just assembly work, including the Raspberry Pi. Even at the chip level, individuals can’t produce them; micro-robots are needed. China couldn’t even produce a ballpoint pen tip before 2010. I’m certainly not capable of producing them.

100. I see only three chips in a phone: one for CPU+GPU+GPS+baseband, another for SD memory, and a third for power management. The first one can be updated online since mobile networks are everywhere—you get a signal even without plugging in an antenna.

101. Explain to me why we can't produce ballpoint pens. The ballpoint pen tip is visible to the naked eye and is considered unproducible, let alone a CPU.

102. I won’t say more—any further discussion is just theoretical. I’m not the head of a factory; I can’t produce good hardware. Otherwise, I could save the world. Haha. (In the future, microcontrollers will need to be registered for use, and you’ll need a phone number—otherwise, providing computing services will be illegal.)
